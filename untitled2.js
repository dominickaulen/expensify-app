// 1. Create a ExpensesSummary Component
// -------------------------------------

//Rendered by ExpenseDashboardPage
//Test with two Snapshot tests
// Connected to store for : 
// expenseCount  (how many visible expenses?) -> these are props you'll get from the redux store
// expensesTotal (what's the total of the visible expenses?) -> I will need to use both selectors to get this piece of info
//expenseTotal should format like its displayed in the example using numeral js 
// expenseCount (which gets the visible expenses) is being used to calculate expensesTotal

//Example 
//Viewing 2 expenses totalling $94.34
//Example 
//Viewing 1 expense totalling $94.34
